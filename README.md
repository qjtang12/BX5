# A building block-based beam-break (B5) locomotor activity monitoring system and its use in circadian biology research
## Introduction
This is a system that uses infrared LEDs and receivers to monitor the locomotor activity of small rodents in biologocal researches.
The manuscript is now published online at:https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2022-0036

I will keep building this project, bare with me please. Highly appreciate any feedbacks on optimizing the system. I am a biology major, so this system is not optimized in engineer's eyes for sure. However, this also means you don't need engineer background to get it going at least.

## Getting Started

4BeamBreak_RTC.ino is the Arduino script operating the system.

# A building block-based beam-break (B5) locomotor activity monitoring system and its use in circadian biology research
The manuscript is now published online at:https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2022-0036
I will keep adding the resources that's needed for building the system. Highly appreciate any feedbacks on optimizing the system. I am a biology major, so this system is not optimized in engineer's eyes for sure. However, this also means you don't need engineer background to get it going at least.

Files in the project:
4BeamBreak_RTC.ino is the Arduino script operating the system.
